This repository contains tools for preparing data to run a [next gen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen) simulation using [NGIAB](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra). The tools allow you to select a catchment of interest on an interactive map, choose a date range, and prepare the data with just a few clicks!

## What does this tool do?

This tool prepares data to run a next gen simulation by creating a run package that can be used with NGIAB. It picks default data sources, including the [v20.1 hydrofabric](https://www.lynker-spatial.com/data?path=hydrofabric%2Fv20.1%2F) and [nwm retrospective v3 forcing](https://noaa-nwm-retrospective-3-0-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#CONUS/zarr/forcing/) data.

## Requirements

* This tool is officially supported on macOS or Ubuntu. To use it on Windows, please install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
* GDAL needs to be installed.
* The 'ogr2ogr' command needs to work in your terminal.

`sudo apt install gdal-bin` will install gdal and ogr2ogr on ubuntu / wsl

## Installation

To install and run the tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess
    cd NGIAB_data_preprocess
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the tool:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. Run the map app:
    ```bash
    python -m map_app
    ```

The first time you run this command, it will download the hydrofabric and model parameter files from Lynker Spatial. If you already have them, place `conus.gpkg` and `model_attributes.parquet` into `modules/data_sources/`.

If step 4 does not work, run the following:

```bash
touch .dev
python -m map_app
```   
    
This .dev file in the root folder disables the automatic browser opening so you will need to manually open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) after running the `python -m map_app` command.   


## Usage

Running the command `python -m map_app` will open the app in a new browser tab. Alternatively, you can manually open it by going to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with the app running.

To use the tool:

1. Select the catchment you're interested in on the map.
2. Pick the time period you want to simulate.
3. Click the following buttons in order:
    1) Create subset gpkg
    2) Create Forcing from Zarrs
    3) Create Realization

Once all the steps are finished, you can run NGIAB on the folder shown underneath the subset button.

**Note:** When using the tool, the output will be stored in the `./output/<your-first-catchment>/` folder. There is no overwrite protection on the folders.
